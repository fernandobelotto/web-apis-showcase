          The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS
          from JavaScript. It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than
          the HTML. It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically.
          The values of CSS are represented untyped, that is using String
          objects.
